# 🎮 Project Title: ICT Quest – Learn by Playing

## 📌 Purpose
Create a **browser-based educational game** for an ICT teacher’s website that helps **students learn ICT concepts through gameplay**.  
The game must support **individual play** and **group/competitive play**, suitable for school environments.

Target users: **Advanced Level school students (Grades 12–13)**  
Subject focus: **Information & Communication Technology (ICT)**

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
Players should learn and practice:
- Computer hardware & software concepts
- Operating systems basics
- Networking fundamentals
- Internet & cybersecurity awareness
- Programming logic (conditions, loops, variables)
- Databases & data representation
- ICT ethics and digital safety

Learning must be **implicit through gameplay**, not textbook-style.

---

## 🧠 Game Concept
**Genre:** Educational RPG + Quiz + Strategy  
**Theme:** Digital world / Cyber city / Virtual lab  

Players explore a virtual ICT world where:
- Each level represents an **ICT topic**
- Challenges simulate **real ICT problems**
- Correct decisions unlock progress
- Wrong choices teach through feedback, not punishment

---

## 🕹️ Game Modes

### 1️⃣ Individual Mode
- Single-player progression
- Levels unlock sequentially
- Score based on accuracy, speed, and logic
- Save progress per student

### 2️⃣ Group / Multiplayer Mode
- Team-based challenges (2–5 players)
- Competitive quizzes
- Cooperative problem-solving missions
- Leaderboards for classes or groups

---

## 🧩 Gameplay Mechanics

### Core Mechanics
- Multiple-choice challenges
- Drag-and-drop logic puzzles
- Match hardware to function
- Network path-building mini-games
- Simple coding challenges (pseudo-code)
- Cybersecurity decision scenarios

### Example Levels
| Level | Topic | Gameplay |
|----|------|--------|
| 1 | Hardware Basics | Build a PC from parts |
| 2 | OS Concepts | Manage processes & memory |
