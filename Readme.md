## 🚀 Key Modules

### 🧪 The Tech Lab
A professional-grade simulation environment where students can analyze hardware components:
- **Optics Lab**: Understand DSLR mirrors, photodiode arrays, and sensor gain (ISO).
- **Signal Lab**: Visualize OFDM waves, frequency modulation, and radio broadcasting.
- **Networking Hub**: Manage L2 Switches with MAC address tables and port forwarding.
- **Circuitry View**: A specialized mode for *all* devices showing internal ASICs, ISPs, and hardware logic paths.

### 🕹️ Interactive Levels
Progressive challenges covering the core ICT syllabus:
- **Level 1 (Hardware)**: PC assembly and component identification.
- **Level 2 (OS)**: Process scheduling and memory management.
- **Level 3 (Networking)**: Packet routing and IP assignment.
- **Level 4-8**: Advanced topics including Logic, Programming, and SQL.
